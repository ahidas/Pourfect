# Pourfect 

## Summary

Pourfect is an automated drink dispenser which detects when a cup is present and pours to the top of the cup. The dispenser has two pouring modes, the first is a
manual pour mode which first takes a value from the user through the QEI encoder. Based on this value the dispenser pours for a set amount of time.
The second mode is an automated pouring mode which pours to within an inch of the top of the cup and then stops.
